  <h3 id="about">About</h3>
  <p>
    I'm a front-end web developer passionate about technology and the simplicity
    of clean code. I believe that great software is built on solid foundations,
    elegant solutions, and attention to detail. I focus on performance,
    modernity and efficient experiences, always seeking the perfect balance
    between aesthetics and functionality. Every project is an opportunity to
    craft interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also fast,
    accessible, and intuitive.
